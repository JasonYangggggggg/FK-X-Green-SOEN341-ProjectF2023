An essential component of our project, broker search capability, has been successfully built by Ali, who has also contributed the code to GitHub. 
His work has improved the user experience overall by producing a strong tool that allows users to look for brokers quickly and effectively. 
Furthermore, the group worked together to resolve a problem pertaining to "seeing users" within the database, showcasing our combined ability to solve problems.
