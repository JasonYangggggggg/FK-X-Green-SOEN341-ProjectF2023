Attendees: Assane, Alimurat, Jason, Mann

By implementing the "submit an offer" capability correctly, Assane assumed responsibility for a critical component of our project. 
This functionality, which enables customers to easily and smoothly submit their offers, is essential to our application. 
Also, Mann made a substantial contribution to the project by carrying out two thorough acceptance tests. 
These tests are essential to confirming that our system satisfies predetermined requirements and performs as planned.
