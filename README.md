## Technologies that we are planning to use: React, Next.js, Typescript, MongoDB, PrismaDB, Tailwind CSS.

### Description of the project:
This project consists of a real estate web application. A real estate web application streamlines the buying, selling, and renting of properties, catering to four primary users: homebuyers, property renters, system administrators, and brokers. Homebuyers search for properties by price range, room size, and other criteria, while property renters seek rental accommodations. The system administrator manages brokers, who can add or remove them and manage their own listings.  

### Project Approach and Technology: 
For this Full Stack web development project, we are planning to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to help us achieve our end goal. We are going to use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as our database and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (bootstrap) to help us fully feature the website and avoid having to use custom CSS. We will also use [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to secure our data password (password hashing). We will create two types of account, one for normal users and the other one for brokers, however this can be changed since we want to let users post the property on our website as well.

<summary><h3>Comparative analysis of frontend frameworks.</h3></summary>  
  
Due to the varying levels of skills in web technologies that the team possesses and the limited timeframe, the emphasis is put on the following criteria for electing a suitable stack: current team familiarity, learning curve, functionality, testability, and modularity. Aspects such as scalability or maintenance are considered but removed from the foreground since growth potential is limited by virtue of this being a school project. Performance is also comparable across the technologies detailed below and therefore will not be a significant factor in the decision.

### Angular  
---
As a fully featured framework, Angular provides everything necessary for the development of web applications. Knowledge of Angular is sparse amongst the team, with no programmers having build a complete website with it. Thanks to its built-in dependency injection system, code is more easily tested than in some other frameworks. However, the steep learning curve and complexity make it a less than desirable option considering the time and overall lack of programmer experience.  
  
### jQuery  
---
A simple, if antiquated alternative to building websites, its capabilities for rapid prototyping and quick development are suited for the agile developmental approach of our team. One programmer in the team has experience using jQuery and in conjunction with its simplicity, allows for the team to be brought up to speed rapidly for development. However, since it is arguably an aging technology, interest of the team in learning jQuery is lacking. Its architectural structure may also encourage novice jQuery users to write disorganized code that is collaborate on and test.  
  
### Next.js  
---
As a modular framework built upon the React library, Next.js is capable of facilitating the production of user interface through its components-based architecture. While it has a shallower learning curve compared to Angular, it remains a sizeable challenge for beginners. However, three of our senior programmers have experience with Next.js or React which may help mitigate this difficulty. The main driver behind our interest in Next.js is the ease of collaboration thanks to its readability and the reusability of components allowing for our initial codebase to be written by our more seasoned engineers and expanded upon by the rest of the team. This allows for a faster developmental process as well. Also, with the introduction of React Hooks in version 16.8, this pivot to more functional programming makes Next.js easier to learn as class components are no longer needed. In short, it is for those reasons that we elected to use Next.js as our frontend framework.

  <summary><h3>Comparative analysis of backend frameworks</h3></summary>  
  
  ### Ruby on Rails
  ---  
  Ruby on Rails (RoR) has the advantage of having its design deeply rooted in conventions that favors programmer productivity. That is to say RoR applies the Don't Repeat Yourself principle means that it has significantly less boilerplate code. Since it is based on Ruby, its syntax is considered generally easy-to-read and its architecture promotes a streamlined decision process which, in conjunction, is very accomodating of new users. That being said, knowledge and experience with Ruby or RoR is non-existant amongst the team and using this backend framework would mean having to learn a completely new language. This undertaking may not be viable with the scope of this project time-wise.
